# tree-util-lite

A comprehensive generic ordered-tree data structure implementation in Python, designed with easy to use API and developer friendly.

In fact, I made it for myself at first, after being tired of reinventing the wheel everytime I work on tree-like data.

It also come with Zhang Shasha tree-edit-distance algorithm, would be helpful for comparing trees.

### Example usages:

 * Representing hierarchical data
 * Detect changes in file/folder structures
 * Compare states in version control system
 * Differences between 3D scene hierarchies
 * So on...
