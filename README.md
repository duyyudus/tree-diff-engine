# tree-util-lite

A comprehensive generic ordered-tree data structure in Python, designed with easy to use API and developer friendly.

In fact, I made it for myself at first, after being tired of reinventing the wheel everytime I work on tree-like data.

It also come with Zhang Shasha tree-edit-distance algorithm, would be helpful for comparing trees.
